changed API_Gateway appsettings remopte services URI format, it's mapped to RemoteService class


HttpIdentityClkient - must be unified RemoteServices URI structure in appsettings for every service



a. - if appsettings will not be centralized in API_Gateway, then for all services, replace old appsettings RemoteService section with (see API_Gateway):

    "InventoryService": {
      "REST": {
        "BaseURL": "http://localhost:7000"
      },
      "AMQP": {
        "BaseURL": "http://localhost:7010"
      }
    }


b. - OR move RemoteServices class from API_Gateway to global Busieness.Management.Services and use it as a singleton service in all services 
        for fetching remote services URLs from Management service and holding it for further use (instead reading them from appsettings). Not readonly because possible update during runtime!

        1 - RemoteServices.cs used as singleton suppose to read appsettings on startup (ctor) into List<RemoteSerrvice> and then be accessible publically.
        2 - What if during the run time appsettings was edited, URLs updated ? Make RemoteServices.cs reload it and update List<RemoteSerrvice> ---- (handle errors as well)
        3 - every remote service shpould download URTL's list from Management service during deployment (program.cs) and handle missing URL in middleware (possibly re-download) and store it into RemoteServices singleton
            OR make background process to manage it





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     --- ORDERING SERVICE and PAYMENT SERVICE are DISABLED - causing problem witrh HttpItemClient because HttpItemClient is uder re-construction !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



                            To Do: replace http clients with appclient and make changes in http services like in http item service. When it works delete all clients 

                            To DO: API_Gateway - RemoteServices Controller and Management - RemoteServices Coontroller -----> add FLUENT VALIDATION !!!

                            To Do: all HttpServices classes in all services -- ad EmptyResult condition like in HttpItemService ------ also "EmptyContent" in condition put into enum so it is not such a hack

                            To Do:  1. send URLs from Management on startup to all services (first try API_Gateway) ---> BackgroundService !!!!!
                                    2. load URLs from Management on startup
                                    3. load URLs from Management on failed request
                                    4. try catch in HttpBaseService --- have to pass httprequestmessage into client
                                    5. FIX all http services, delete all http clients ....

                            NOTE: Management service is called after wrong URL, but when it's called as a main request (on startup) it is called twice if it's not online :)


                            






                            To Do: ALL HTTP services --> make only one HTTP method. All parameters (get/post/del, query string, content ...) inserted by callers (services) --> services and httpservices are identical

                            To Do: ----------------------------> WHAT if Management API service sends new Global Config UPDATE with NEW/UPDATED Management API service URL to all services ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Implement UPDATE/Rewrite functionality to correct data in Appsettings !!!




                            To Do: ManagementService - > functionality for managinfg the remote services (ID's, etc)
