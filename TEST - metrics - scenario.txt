TEST:

		API_Gateway	ON
		Ordering	OFF
		Identity	OFF
		Management	ON

	Request:
		Scenario: API_Gateway -> Ordering -> Identity

		API_Gateway -> Ordering		503
		API_Gateway -> Management	200
		API_Gateway -> Ordering		503
		
		Ordring was OFF so API_Gateway sent request to Management to get URLs
		
	
	Result:
		
		8000 is Ordering sevice
		
		Data:

		{
			"data": null,
